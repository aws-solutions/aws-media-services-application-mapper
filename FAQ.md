MSAM is installed into an AWS account using several CloudFormation templates.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How can I restrict access to the MSAM web bucket?

The MSAM web bucket is created with public GetObject permissions. This means someone who knows the names of keys in the bucket can gain read-only access to them. Most of the time this is fine for a web site. You can use a Condition keyword in the bucket policy to restrict Actions by IP address. The example below modifies the default bucket policy generated by CloudFormation to include IP address block filters.

```
{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AddPerm",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::msam-test-app-msambrowserappbucket-ceo13n9cja7z/*",
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": [
                        "205.221.233.166/29",
                        "205.241.233.38/29"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
