# Solution Overview
[//]: # (What does the solution do? What customer problem does it solve? Mention specific use cases)
* AWS Media Services Application Mapper (MSAM) is a browser-based tool that allows operators to visualize the structure and logical connections among AWS Media Services and supporting services in the cloud.
* MSAM can be used as a top-down resource monitoring tool when integrated with CloudWatch.
* MSAM offers two different visualization options: Diagrams and Tiles. 
* MSAM can be configured to automatically display AWS Media Services alerts from AWS Elemental MediaLive channels and multiplex and AWS Elemental MediaConnect.

**Go [here](docs/FEATURES.md) for more information on MSAM's capabilities and features.**

<a name="installation"></a>
# Installation Guide
Go [here](docs/INSTALL.md) for more information on installing MSAM into your AWS account.

<a name="architecture-diagram"></a>
# Architecture Diagram
[//]: # (Provide Architecture Diagram. Add few bullets to describe the architecture workflow)
You'll find the various architectural views for MSAM [here](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
<a name="aws-solutions-constructs"></a><a name="customizing-the-solution"></a>
# Customizing the Solution

<a name="prerequisites-for-customization"></a>
## Prerequisites for Customization
[//]: # (Add any prerequisites for customization steps. e.g. Prerequisite: Node.js>10)

* Install/update to Python 3.x
* Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Create a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/venv.html) using [requirements.txt](deployment/requirements.txt) and activate it
* Configure the bucket name of your target Amazon S3 distribution bucket
```
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # bucket where customized code will reside
export SOLUTION_NAME=my-solution-name
export VERSION=my-version # version number for the customized code
```
_Note:_ You would have to create an S3 bucket with the prefix '_my-bucket-name-<aws_region>_'.  aws_region is where you are testing the customized solution. Also, the assets in bucket should be publicly accessible.

<a name="build"></a>
## Build
[//]: # (Add commands to build lambda binaries from root of the project)
To build the distributable and prepare the CloudFormation templates:
```
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION
```

CloudFormation templates will be written to deployment/global-s3-assets.

Lambda binaries will be written to deployment/regional-s3-assets.


<a name="unit-test"></a>
## Unit Test
[//]: # (Add commands to run unit tests from root of the project)

TBD

<a name="deploy"></a>
## Deploy
[//]: # (Add commands to deploy the solution's stacks from the root of the project)

Deploy the distributable to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. 

1. From the deployment directory run the _deploy.sh_ script. 

Script usage:
```
./deploy.sh [-b BucketBasename] [-s SolutionName] [-v VersionString] [-r RegionsForDeploy] [-p AWSProfile] [-a ACLSettings(public-read|none)] [-t DeployType(dev|release)] 
```

Example usage:
```
 ./deploy.sh -b mybucket -s aws-media-services-application-mapper -v v1.8.0 -r "us-west-2 us-east-1 us-east-2" -p default -a public-read -t dev


```

All CloudFormation templates and lambda binaries will end up in:

``` 
s3://my-bucket-aws-region/solution-name/version/
```

If deploying with type _release_, CloudFormation templates will also be written to:
``` 
s3://my-bucket-aws-region/solution-name/latest/
```

2.  Get the link of the solution template uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.

``` 
s3://my-bucket-aws-region/solution-name/latest/aws-media-services-application-mapper-release.template

OR

s3://my-bucket-aws-region/solution-name/version/aws-media-services-application-mapper-timestamp.template
```

3. Deploy the solution to your account by launching a new AWS CloudFormation stack using the link of the solution template in Amazon S3.
